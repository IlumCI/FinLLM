# LAMb roadmap

v0.1 is a faithful, CPU-runnable scaffold of the full architecture. The
extensions below are ordered roughly by leverage. Consult arXiv for the latest
work before implementing each — several of these are active 2025–2026 areas.

## 1. GRPO-trained hypernetwork proposer (implemented)

Implemented in `lamb/selfplay/hyperproposer.py` (`proposer_kind="grpo_hyper"`): a
hypernetwork maps solver competence to task-distribution logits, trained by GRPO
with learnability rewards and a **KL anchor to the bandit** (the anti-collapse
mechanism). The bandit stays the recommended default; the hypernetwork is the
drop-in for large task spaces.

Remaining upgrades:

- **Heavier hypernetwork.** Emit the *weights* of a small task-generator network
  rather than the distribution parameters directly — needed once the task space
  is continuous/compositional rather than a fixed grid.
- **Richer context.** Feed recent success slope and memory-utilisation stats, not
  just per-cell success, so the policy anticipates the frontier.
- **Mixture annealing.** Anneal the coverage floor `eps` down as the policy
  earns trust.

([2508.05004](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05004)).

## 2. GRPO / RLVR on the solver (implemented)

Implemented (`solver_algo="grpo"`): sampled-group answers scored by the exact
verifier, group-relative advantages, KL to a refreshed reference, added on top of
expert iteration (a warm start that avoids the RL cold-start). Includes DAPO
dynamic sampling and an optional Dr.GRPO no-std normalization.

Remaining: replace the SFT warm start with a scheduled hand-off; GSPO
sequence-level ratios; clip-higher (DAPO) once multiple epochs per rollout are
used. Refs: DAPO, Dr.GRPO, GSPO.

## 2b. Benchmark harness

Build out the battery in [`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md): a length-generalization
eval ships in `lamb.eval.length_generalization`; add long-context recall
(needle / passkey / BABILong-style) and a latent-reasoning task (ProntoQA/ProsQA)
adapter. General-LLM suites (MMLU) are out of scope until a language front-end
exists.

## 3. Continuous-thought decoding (full Coconut)

The core already reasons in latent space via recurrent depth. Add the Coconut
inference mode: feed the last hidden state back as the next *input* embedding for
several "thought" steps between emitted tokens, enabling breadth-first latent
search on backtracking-heavy problems.

Ref: Coconut ([2412.06769](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769)).

## 4. Deeper test-time memory (ATLAS)

Upgrade the linear delta-rule memory to a small non-linear MLP memory with a
momentum ("surprise") term and Muon/second-order-style updates, targeting the
10M-token regime. Wire the Rust `TopKStore` as an exact retrieval tier alongside
the compressive neural memory.

Refs: Titans; ATLAS ([2505.23735](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23735)).

## 5. Richer task space

Multi-term nested expressions, division/modulo, mixed radices, rationals, and
eventually symbolic/algebraic goals — the combinatorial space where the
hypernetwork proposer (item 1) earns its keep. The Rust verifier already parses
general `+ − * ( )`; extend its grammar and the tokenizer in lockstep.

## 6. Number representation experiments

A/B the value channel against BitTokens (IEEE-754 as one token) and Adelic
operation-preserving embeddings; sweep digit base and reversal.

Refs: *Numbers Already Carry Their Own Embeddings* ([2606.14108](https://arxiv.org/html/2606.14108v1)); BitTokens.

## 7. Scale-up path

GPU training, mixed precision, larger `d_model`/depth, and a serving mode. The
architecture is unchanged; only config and device move.
